**Abstract:** Nonlinear standing waves known as Faraday waves are formed in vibrating liquids enclosed by a container. In an effort to further our understanding of the relation between frequency and wave propagation within spatial boundaries we present a taxonomy to classify the variety of the observed resonant phenomena. This taxonomy includes some new definitions and suggests a unified language for describing wave propagation phenomena. We investigated the observed resonant phenomena and complex nonlinear dynamics utilising the Cymascope instrument, which works by transposing sound periodicities to water molecule periodicities.
