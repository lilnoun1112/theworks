**Description:** An environmental sound loudspeaker comprises a loudspeaker driver (100), at least two microphones (104!, 1042), and a signal processor (110). The microphones (1041f 1042) are positioned a distance d apart, diametrically opposite each other and equidistant relative to a centre of the loudspeaker driver (100). The signal processor (110) determines an output signal (129) based on the input signals (113i, 1132) received from the microphones (1041f 1042) and provides the output signal (129) to the loudspeaker driver (100). The determination of the output signal (129) comprises inverting (114i) one of the input signals (1132) before combining (116i) it with the other input signal (113i), and amplifying (122) the combined signal. The amplifying (122) comprises attenuating signals with a frequency higher than a first frequency and boosting signals with a frequency lower than a second frequency. The first and second frequencies are based on the distance d between the microphones.
