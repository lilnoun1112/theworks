**Abstract:** Methods and systems are disclosed for signal processing, in particular of an entrainment signal. A signal processing module is described which comprises a first signal input for receiving an input signal *x in*, a signal output for providing an output signal *x out* to an output device, and a second signal input for receiving a recorded signal *y*. The recorded signal *y* represents a recording of the output generated by the output device. The signal processing module further comprises signal processing circuitry configured to generate the output signal by adding the input signal and a difference α (*x ref - y*) between a reference signal and the recorded signal: *x out = x in + α (x ref - y).* The reference signal can be the input signal, the output signal, or an external reference signal. The input signal can be an entrainment signal.
