**Abstract:** Sound reproduction is the electro-mechanical re-creation of sound waves using analogue and digital audio equipment. Although sound reproduction implies that repeated acoustical events are close to identical, numerous fixed and variable conditions affect the acoustic result. To arrive at a better understanding of the magnitude of deviations in sound reproduction, amplitude deviation and phase distortion of a sound signal were measured at various reproduction stages and compared under a set of controlled acoustical conditions, one condition being the presence of a human subject in the acoustic test environment. Deviations in electroacoustic reproduction were smaller than ±0.2 dB amplitude and ±3 degrees phase shift when comparing trials recorded on the same day (Δ*t* < 8 h, mean uncertainty u = 1.58%). Deviations increased significantly with greater than two times the amplitude and three times the phase shift when comparing trials recorded on different days (Δ*t* > 16 h, u = 4.63%). Deviations further increased significantly with greater than 15 times the amplitude and the phase shift when a human subject was present in the acoustic environment (u = 24.64%). For the first time, this study shows that the human body does not merely absorb but can also cause amplification of sound energy. The degree of attenuation or amplification per frequency shows complex variance depending on the type of reproduction and the subject, indicating a nonlinear dynamic interaction. The findings of this study may serve as a reference to update acoustical standards and improve accuracy and reliability of sound reproduction and its application in measurements, diagnostics and therapeutic methods.
