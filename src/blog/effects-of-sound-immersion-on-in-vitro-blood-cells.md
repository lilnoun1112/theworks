**Abstract:** The effects of sound and mechanical vibrations on blood flow and in vitro and in vivo blood cells were previously reported in various studies. Frequency-based stimulation and sound vibrations were shown to have a positive effect on peripheral blood flow, blood aggregation, Red Blood Cells longevity and enhanced release of Nitric Oxide which supports improved blood oxygenation. Different frequencies were also reported to have discrete effects on cells and physiological mechanisms. In this preliminary study, we investigated the effect of 20 minutes exposure to audible sound stimuli comprising recordings of spatial sound projections of a singing bowl at 40 Hz and 73 Hz compared to 20 minutes silence in a Faraday cage (control) on in vitro Red Blood Cells and White Blood Cells. We find that the sound stimuli have a highly significant effect on the longevity of both Red and White Blood Cells with a differentiation in effect across frequencies and projections compared to control. Results could indicate a cost-effective treatment to support improved soundness of blood transfusions as well as non-invasive interventions to increase circulating blood cells.
