**Abstract:** Standing waves formed on a vibrating fluid layer when a critical amplitude is applied are known as Faraday waves. The morphology of the observed phenomena is dependent on both the frequency of vibration and the boundary conditions. To understand the degree of this dependency, as well as any internal or external factors, we investigated the resonant phenomena observed in a circular cuvette for a range of frequencies. We find the symmetry fold is dependent on both the driving frequency and the amplitude. However, variance was consistently observed which showed no significant dependence on internal or external factors. We discuss possible causes for this variance and potential future research.
