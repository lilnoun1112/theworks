**Abstract:** In general sound waves propagate radially outwards from a point source. These waves will continue in the same direction, decreasing in intensity, unless a boundary condition is met. To arrive at a universal understanding of the relation between frequency and wave propagation within spatial boundaries, an analysis and comparison is made between the results of Chladni plate experiments and Chladni plate simulations. We consider a finite range of frequencies and plate geometries and present a model that has been shown to successfully recreate the nodal line patterns to a first approximation. We discuss the benefits of such a model and the future work necessary to develop the model to its full predictive capacity.
