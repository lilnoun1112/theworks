Spectrum is a closed headphones system with built-in omnidirectional microphones and audio processing functions. 

A personalized sound experience is provided by real-time capturing of the user’s individual acoustic profile by the microphones \[1,2] to optimize acoustic entrainment through the headphones. This new built-in technology enhances the quality of sound experience and promotes homeostasis in the user, resulting in greater physical and emotional health and resilience. An effective session using Spectrum takes between 15–40 minutes, depending on the intended effect \[1]. 

Effects of sound interventions have been observed relating to effective stress alleviation \[1,2,3], regulation of arousal for mood and sleep modulation \[1,3], promotion of cardiovascular functions and blood cell longevity \[1,4], increased focus, attention, innovative thinking, heightened creativity and improved memory functions \[1,2,3] and other reported benefits \[1,2,3,4]. With Spectrum, the benefits of sound intervention become available through the compact format of headphones.

Assessment and monitoring of sessions is provided by personal reports accessible through an online app. The reports translate acoustic information captured by the headphones to factors relating to the user’s physical, emotional and mental wellbeing.
