**Abstract:** In this paper, we utilise optimization methods to determine a frequency-independent phase shift such that two phase-shifted versions of a signal can be summed and the resulting amplitude spectrum is unchanged. A phase difference between two signals is thus defined, which remains constant for all frequencies within a given range. For the intended purpose of this study, we set the frequency range to the audible human hearing range of 16 Hz–20 kHz. We found that a new 3-stage filter method provides a variable phase shifter (i.e., ϕ = 0–360°) without the need for additional amplifiers. In addition, we present a new method that reduces the number of filters necessary, improving both the accuracy and efficiency of current techniques.
