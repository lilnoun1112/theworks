**Description:** A method for generating an audio signal associated with a virtual sound source is disclosed. The method comprises obtaining an input audio signal *x(t)* and modifying the input audio signal *x(t)* to obtain a modified audio signal. The latter step comprises performing a signal delay operation. Optionally, modifying the input audio signal comprises a signal inverting operation and/or a signal amplification or attenuation and/or a signal feedback operation. The method further comprises generating the audio signal *y(t)* based on a combination, e.g. a summation, of the input audio signal *x(t)* and the modified audio signal.
