A POP (Point of Presence) is a spherical, water-resistant sound transducer for placement in outdoor environments, with integrated omnidirectional microphone and loudspeaker system and on-board audio processing functions, self-charging power source, location tracking sensor and mesh network function connecting multiple devices to a central processing unit. 



Environmental sound is captured by the POPs to assess the richness, abundance, evenness, and diversity of species within a given ecosystem. Based on continuous assessment, acoustic enrichment is auto-determined and soundscape broadcasting is continuously optimized. In this way, POPs facilitate acoustic restoration in disturbed terrestrial and aquatic areas, which can accelerate recolonisation of animals and the microbes and propagules they carry.



POPs can be networked to form mobile multi-channel broadcasting configurations covering extended environmental areas. The central processing unit connecting a network of POPS is used to monitor and report on the restorative process of the area over an extended duration of time.
