**Description:** A method for generating a reverberation audio signal associated with a virtual object is disclosed. The method comprises storing a representation of the virtual object, the representation defining a plurality of virtual points constituting the virtual object, wherein the virtual points have respective virtual positions with respect to each other, and wherein the virtual points belong to symmetry groups of virtual points. Each symmetry group of virtual points is associated with a set of one or more symmetry group distances. The sets of one or more symmetry group distances which sets are respectively associated with symmetry groups, together form a further set of one or more distances. The method further comprises receiving and/or storing and/or generating an input audio signal, and, for each virtual point, determining, based on the input audio signal, or filtered version thereof, a virtual point audio signal component. The method also comprises combining the virtual point audio signal components to obtain a composite audio signal, and determining for each distinct distance in the further set of one or more distances, based on the composite audio signal one or more distance audio signals. The method also comprises determining the reverberation audio signal based on the one or more distance audio signals and the virtual point audio signal components.
