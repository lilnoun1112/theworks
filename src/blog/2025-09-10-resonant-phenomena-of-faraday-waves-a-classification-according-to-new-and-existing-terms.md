**Abstract:** Nonlinear standing waves known as Faraday waves are formed in vibrating liquids enclosed by a container. To further our understanding of the relation between frequency and wave propagation within spatial boundaries, we investigated Faraday wave phenomena utilizing the CymaScope instrument, which works by transposing sonic periodicities to water wavelet periodicities. This paper presents the resulting observations and suggests a unified language for describing sound-induced resonant wave phenomena.
