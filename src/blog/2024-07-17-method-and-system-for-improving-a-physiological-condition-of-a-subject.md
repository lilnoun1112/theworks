**Abstract:** A method for improving a physiological condition of a subject, e.g. a human or animal, is disclosed. The method comprises providing an audio signal to the subject, wherein the audio signal is associated with a virtual sound source having a shape and a position relative to the subject. The virtual sound source is defined by a plurality of virtual points, each virtual point having a position relative to the subject. The audio signal comprises audio signal components for the respective virtual points of the virtual sound source, wherein each audio signal component has been determined based on the virtual position of its associated virtual point such that the audio signal is perceived by the subject as originating from the virtual sound source having said shape and said position relative to the subject. Further, a system for performing this method is also disclosed.
