**Abstract:** Sound reproduction is the electro-mechanical re-creation of sound waves using analogue and digital audio equipment. Although identical reproduction of a sound is implied to be acoustically identical, numerous fixed and variable conditions are affecting the acoustic result. To arrive at a better understanding of the causes and the extent of deviations in sound reproduction, differences in the amplitude, phase and frequency of a sound signal at various stages in the process of reproduction were measured and compared under a set of controlled conditions, one of them being the presence of a human subject in the acoustic environment. Deviations in acoustic reproduction were found to be significantly smaller than ± 0.1 dB amplitude and ± 1 degree phase shift when comparing trials recorded on the same day. Deviations significantly increased greater than 5 times the amplitude and 6 times the phase shift when comparing trials recorded on different days. Deviations further increased significantly with greater than 59 times the amplitude and 32 times the phase shift with a human subject present in the acoustic environment. For the first time, it was shown that the human body does not always absorb, but can also amplify sound energy. The degree of either absorption or amplification per frequency shows consistent variance in response to the subject and changes in the stimulus, indicating a non-linear relationship between the observed deviations and the presence of the human subject. The findings of the present study may serve as a reference for acoustic standards and corrective methods improving the accuracy and predictability of sound reproduction and its applications in measurement, diagnostics and therapeutic methods.
