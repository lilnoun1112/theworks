**Abstract:** The emerging research into spatial sound as a medium, in conjunction with recent technical developments in spatial sound processing and acoustic holography, provides a new field of study that may further the understanding of the principles of sound wave propagation and how to make use of its potential effects on human wellbeing. Prior studies conducted during recent years show that spatial coherence of sound waves may have a distinct effect on harnessing energy in natural systems, such as improved homeostasis in the human body. Spatial coherence of sound is understood as the alignment of sound waves in specific symmetrical patterns and the amplification of associated harmonic spectra as a result, which coincides with an observed improvement of the physiological and psychological state of subjects exposed to the sound waves. We consider these aspects to be intertwined as part of a unified non-discrete system, meaning the connectome of various natural systems bound by the fundamental principle of syntropy (negentropy). This notion informs and gives rise to the hypothesis that spatial projection of sound may provide a means for Acoustic Effector Stimulation (AES) to help restore, maintain and optimize balance in cell organisms, implying potential applications for treatment and prevention of pathological conditions associated with disease and trauma.
