The Sphere is a sound-proof spherical pod for one person to sit inside, with integrated omnidirectional microphone and loudspeaker system, vibro-acoustic chair and on-board spatial audio processing and data processing functions. 

A personalized sound treatment is provided by projecting sound waves and vibrations onto the user’s body and real-time capturing the user’s individual acoustic profile to optimize acoustic entrainment. In this way, the Sphere guides the user towards improved homeostasis, which promotes greater physical and emotional health and resilience. A treatment session in the Sphere takes between 15–40 minutes, depending on the intended effect \[1]. 

Effects of sound interventions with the Sphere have been observed relating to effective stress alleviation \[1,2,3], regulation of arousal for mood and sleep modulation \[1,3], promotion of cardiovascular functions and blood cell longevity \[1,4], increased focus, attention, innovative thinking, heightened creativity and improved memory functions \[1,2,3] and other reported benefits \[1,2,3,4]. The effects during and after a treatment may vary among users depending on their personal condition and needs.

Assessment and monitoring of sessions is provided by personal reports accessible through an online app. The reports translate acoustic information captured in the Sphere to factors relating to the user’s physical, emotional and mental wellbeing.
